HostProfiles can be structured in a hierarchy so that many HostProfiles can inherit generic attributes from a parent HostProfile. This hierarchy can be defined in multiple layers; with lower layers overriding attributes set in higher layers. \n At configuration time, before a Host is configured, the hierarchy of HostProfile resources is flattened to produce a single composite profile that represents the final attributes as they are overridden down the HostProfile hierarchy. \n Once the HostProfile hierarchy is flattened to a composite profile.  The Deployment Manager will further refine the profile to create a final HostProfile which serves as the final configuration for the Host resource.  To create the final HostProfile, the Deployment Manages merges the composite profile with the initial default host attributes, and then merges the individual host overrides into that result.  The process can be illustrated as follows: \n Host Defaults      +---------------------+ |                                      \\ |                                       \\ Base Profile        +                       \\ |                 \\                       \\ ...                  + Composite Profile ----+  Final Profile |                 /                        / Personality Profile(s) +                        / |                                        / |                                       / Host                                    / |                                     / |                                    / Host Overrides       +-----------------+ \n Merging two HostProfileSpec resources consists of merging the attributes of a higher precedence profile into the attributes of a lower precedences profile.  The rules for merging attributes are as follows. \n 1) A nil pointer is always overwritten by a non-nil pointer. \n 2) Two non-nil pointers are merged together according to the underlying type. \n 2a) If the type pointed to is a primitive type (e.g., int, bool, string, etc) then the higher precedence value is used). \n 2b) If the type pointed to is a structure then this same merge procedure is repeated recursively on each field of the structure with these same rules applying to each field. \n 2c) If the type pointed to is a slice/array then rule (3) is used. \n 2d) If the type pointed to is a map then higher precedence value is used and the entire map is overwritten. \n 3) Two slices are merged together using the following sub-rules. \n 3a) If the elements of slices define the KeyEqual() method then an attempt is made to try to merge equivalent element using this same merge strategy.  Elements from the higher precedence list that do not have an equivalent in the lower precedence list are appended to the list.  Elements appearing in the lower precedence list but not in the higher precedence list are kept intact. \n 3b) If the elements of the slices do not define the KeyEqual() method then they are simply concatenated together. \n 3c) An empty slice is handled as a special case that deletes the contents of the lower precedence slice.  Do not confuse an empty slice with a nil slice pointer."

HostProfiles can be structured in a hierarchy so that many HostProfiles can inherit generic attributes from a parent HostProfile. This hierarchy can be defined in multiple layers; with lower layers overriding attributes set in higher layers. \n At configuration time, before a Host is configured, the hierarchy of HostProfile resources is flattened to produce a single composite profile that represents the final attributes as they are overridden down the HostProfile hierarchy. \n Once the HostProfile hierarchy is flattened to a composite profile.  The Deployment Manager will further refine the profile to create a final HostProfile which serves as the final configuration for the Host resource.  To create the final HostProfile, the Deployment Manages merges the composite profile with the initial default host attributes, and then merges the individual host overrides into that result.  The process can be illustrated as follows: \n Host Defaults      +---------------------+ |                                      \\ |                                       \\ Base Profile        +                       \\ |                 \\                       \\ ...                  + Composite Profile ----+  Final Profile |                 /                        / Personality Profile(s) +                        / |                                        / |                                       / Host                                    / |                                     / |                                    / Host Overrides       +-----------------+ \n Merging two HostProfileSpec resources consists of merging the attributes of a higher precedence profile into the attributes of a lower precedences profile.  The rules for merging attributes are as follows. \n 1) A nil pointer is always overwritten by a non-nil pointer. \n 2) Two non-nil pointers are merged together according to the underlying type. \n 2a) If the type pointed to is a primitive type (e.g., int, bool, string, etc) then the higher precedence value is used). \n 2b) If the type pointed to is a structure then this same merge procedure is repeated recursively on each field of the structure with these same rules applying to each field. \n 2c) If the type pointed to is a slice/array then rule (3) is used. \n 2d) If the type pointed to is a map then higher precedence value is used and the entire map is overwritten. \n 3) Two slices are merged together using the following sub-rules. \n 3a) If the elements of slices define the KeyEqual() method then an attempt is made to try to merge equivalent element using this same merge strategy.  Elements from the higher precedence list that do not have an equivalent in the lower precedence list are appended to the list.  Elements appearing in the lower precedence list but not in the higher precedence list are kept intact. \n 3b) If the elements of the slices do not define the KeyEqual() method then they are simply concatenated together. \n 3c) An empty slice is handled as a special case that deletes the contents of the lower precedence slice.  Do not confuse an empty slice with a nil slice pointer."
