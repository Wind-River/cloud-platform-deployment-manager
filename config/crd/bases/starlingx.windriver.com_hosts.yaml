                      attributes from a parent HostProfile. This hierarchy can be
                      defined in multiple layers; with lower layers overriding attributes
                      set in higher layers. \n At configuration time, before a Host
                      is configured, the hierarchy of HostProfile resources is flattened
                      to produce a single composite profile that represents the final
                      attributes as they are overridden down the HostProfile hierarchy.
                      \n Once the HostProfile hierarchy is flattened to a composite
                      profile.  The Deployment Manager will further refine the profile
                      to create a final HostProfile which serves as the final configuration
                      for the Host resource.  To create the final HostProfile, the
                      Deployment Manages merges the composite profile with the initial
                      default host attributes, and then merges the individual host
                      overrides into that result.  The process can be illustrated
                      as follows: \n Host Defaults      +---------------------+ |

                      resources consists of merging the attributes of a higher precedence
                      profile into the attributes of a lower precedences profile.
                      \ The rules for merging attributes are as follows. \n 1) A nil
                      pointer is always overwritten by a non-nil pointer. \n 2) Two
                      non-nil pointers are merged together according to the underlying
                      type. \n 2a) If the type pointed to is a primitive type (e.g.,
                      int, bool, string, etc) then the higher precedence value is
                      used). \n 2b) If the type pointed to is a structure then this
                      same merge procedure is repeated recursively on each field of
                      the structure with these same rules applying to each field.
                      \n 2c) If the type pointed to is a slice/array then rule (3)
                      is used. \n 2d) If the type pointed to is a map then higher
                      precedence value is used and the entire map is overwritten.
                      \n 3) Two slices are merged together using the following sub-rules.
                      \n 3a) If the elements of slices define the KeyEqual() method
                      then an attempt is made to try to merge equivalent element using
                      this same merge strategy.  Elements from the higher precedence
                      list that do not have an equivalent in the lower precedence
                      list are appended to the list.  Elements appearing in the lower
                      precedence list but not in the higher precedence list are kept
                      intact. \n 3b) If the elements of the slices do not define the
                      KeyEqual() method then they are simply concatenated together.
                      \n 3c) An empty slice is handled as a special case that deletes
                      the contents of the lower precedence slice.  Do not confuse
                      an empty slice with a nil slice pointer."
